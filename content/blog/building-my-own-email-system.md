# Why I Built My Own Email System Instead of Using ConvertKit or SendGrid

When I decided to start a newsletter, I had the same choice every creator faces: use an existing service like ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or SendGrid, or build my own system. I went with building my own, and I'm glad I did.

In this post, I'll share why I made that choice, how I used a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to plan everything out, and the technical stack that powers my newsletter infrastructure.

## The Email Service Dilemma

### What Most People Use

When I started researching, these were the popular options:

- **ConvertKit**: $29/month for 1,000 subscribers
- **Mailchimp**: $20/month for 500 subscribers
- **SendGrid**: $15/month for 50,000 emails
- **Substack**: 10% of subscription revenue
- **Beehiiv**: $42/month for unlimited subscribers

### The Hidden Costs I Found

While these services look affordable at first, the costs really add up:

- Monthly fees that keep increasing as you grow
- Limited customization for branding and functionality
- Data ownership concerns - your subscriber list isn't really yours
- API limitations and rate limits
- Vendor lock-in that makes it hard to switch later

## Why I Chose to Build My Own

### 1. Cost Control
My system costs about $5-10/month for 10,000+ subscribers, compared to $50-100/month with traditional services. That's a huge difference.

### 2. Complete Control
I own my data, control my branding, and can customize every aspect of the user experience. No more fighting with platform limitations.

### 3. Learning Opportunity
Building an email system taught me valuable skills in AWS, API development, and email infrastructure that I can use in other projects.

### 4. Scalability
My system can handle growth without the exponential cost increases that come with most email services.

## The PRD Approach: Planning Before Building

Before I wrote a single line of code, I created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD). This was probably the smartest thing I did.

### What is a PRD?

A PRD (Product Requirements Document) is basically a blueprint that defines:
- What I'm building
- Why I'm building it
- Who it's for
- How it should work
- How I'll measure success

### My PRD Structure

```
1. Executive Summary
2. Problem Statement
3. User Personas
4. Functional Requirements
5. Technical Requirements
6. Success Metrics
7. Implementation Timeline
8. Risk Assessment
```

## The PRD in Action

### My Problem Statement
*"I need a cost-effective, customizable email system that gives me complete control over my newsletter infrastructure while maintaining professional deliverability and analytics."*

### User Personas I Identified
- **Primary**: Content creators who want control over their email infrastructure
- **Secondary**: Small businesses looking for affordable email marketing solutions
- **Tertiary**: Developers wanting to learn email system architecture

### Functional Requirements I Listed

#### Core Features
1. **Email Sending**: Reliable delivery with high inbox placement
2. **List Management**: Add, remove, and segment subscribers
3. **Template System**: Customizable email templates
4. **Analytics**: Open rates, click rates, and subscriber growth
5. **Admin Interface**: Easy-to-use dashboard for management

#### Advanced Features
1. **Automation**: Welcome sequences and drip campaigns
2. **A/B Testing**: Subject line and content testing
3. **Segmentation**: Target specific subscriber groups
4. **API Access**: Programmatic control for integrations

### Technical Requirements

#### Infrastructure
- **Email Service**: AWS SES for reliable delivery
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for subscriber management
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API
- **Frontend**: React for admin interface
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 or Vercel for deployment

#### Performance Requirements
- **Delivery Rate**: >95% inbox placement
- **Send Rate**: 10,000 emails/hour
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Response Time**: <200ms for API calls

## The Technical Implementation

### AWS SES Setup

AWS Simple Email Service (SES) is the backbone of my email system:

```javascript
// Example SES configuration
const sesConfig = {
  region: 'us-east-1',
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  }
}
```

**Why I chose SES:**
- **Cost**: $0.10 per 1,000 emails (vs $15-50 with other services)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of emails
- **Integration**: Seamless AWS ecosystem integration

### Database Design

I designed a simple but scalable database schema:

```sql
-- Subscribers table
CREATE TABLE subscribers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  subscribed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  tags TEXT[]
);

-- Campaigns table
CREATE TABLE campaigns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft'
);

-- Analytics table
CREATE TABLE email_analytics (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id INTEGER REFERENCES campaigns(id),
  subscriber_id INTEGER REFERENCES subscribers(id),
  event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  event_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Architecture

My RESTful API provides programmatic access:

```javascript
// Example API endpoints
POST /api/subscribers          // Add new subscriber
GET /api/subscribers           // List subscribers
DELETE /api/subscribers/:id    // Remove subscriber
POST /api/campaigns            // Create campaign
POST /api/campaigns/:id/send   // Send campaign
GET /api/analytics             // Get analytics data
```

## My Development Process

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Hours 1-2)
- Set up AWS SES and verify domain
- Create database schema
- Build basic API endpoints
- Implement email sending functionality

### Phase 2: Admin Interface (Hours 3-4)

## What I Learned

### 1. PRD is Essential
The Product Requirements Document saved me hours of development time and prevented costly mistakes.

### 2. Start Simple
I built the MVP first, then added advanced features. This approach reduced complexity and risk.

### 3. Email Infrastructure is Complex
Deliverability, compliance, and scaling require careful planning and ongoing attention.

### 4. AWS Ecosystem is Powerful
Using AWS services together provides reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

### 5. Documentation Matters
Good documentation makes maintenance and future development much easier.

## Future Enhancements I'm Planning

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Automation**: Complex drip campaigns and triggers
- **AI-Powered Content**: Subject line optimization and content suggestions
- **Advanced Analytics**: Cohort analysis and predictive insights
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android admin app
- **API Marketplace**: Allow other developers to build integrations

### Scaling Considerations
- **Microservices**: Break down into smaller, focused services
- **Caching**: Redis for improved performance
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global content delivery
- **Monitoring**: Advanced alerting and error tracking

## My Takeaway

Building my own email system was one of the best decisions I made for my content business. While it required upfront investment in time and learning, the long-term benefits in cost savings, control, and learning have been invaluable.

The key to success was the PRD - it provided a clear roadmap and helped me avoid common pitfalls. The technical implementation was challenging but educational, and the result is a system that perfectly fits my needs.

If you're considering building your own email system, here's what I'd recommend:
1. **Start with a PRD** to define your requirements clearly
2. **Begin with a simple MVP** and iterate
3. **Focus on deliverability** from day one
4. **Plan for compliance** and security
5. **Document everything** for future maintenance

The email marketing landscape is evolving, and having control over your infrastructure gives you a competitive advantage. Plus, the skills you learn building an email system are transferable to many other projects.
